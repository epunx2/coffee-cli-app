# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
  I added the cli class which outputs what the program does, asks for input, and outputs a response back with information about coffee roasts
- [x] Pull data from an external source
  The information about the coffee roasts is pulled from wikipedia
- [x] Implement both list and detail views
  The user can list out the different roasts as well as get details about each one.
